# PixelRake
PixelRake is a pixel based image creation software. Though it is not completed, it does have some interesting features. Images can be loaded in and saved. The tool pallet includes pixel by pixel modification, line tools, and a fill tool. The most interesting implementation is the art pallet. This dialog allows colors to be dragged in from either the loaded image or the color chooser. When a color is dropped, it becomes a randomly generated splotch on the pallet view. Splotches can be dragged into the image for modification. When splotches are dragged such that they overlap, the intersection becomes the combination of the two splotch colors.
